to install ionic and cordova, run:

npm install -g cordova ionic






to build the app, run:

ionic build ios
ionic build android







To debug in a browser, run:

ionic lab





Install Android Studio and Xcode.
You can open the appropriate app under 
mobile/platforms/[ios,android]
and run the app from there.



Remember to rebuild before running the app again to make
sure all your changes get translated to ios and android.
Using ionic lab should do this for you I think.
