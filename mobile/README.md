install ionic and cordova, run:  
  
`npm install -g cordova ionic`

The first time you pull from git there are a lot of things missing. To get up and running do:  
  
`npm install`  
`ionic platform add ios`  
`ionic platform add android`  
(open **ghvz/mobile/platforms/ios/ghv.xcodeproj** in xcode,  
click "ghvz" on the left, under the "General" tab go to "Signing" and add your apple account under "Team")  
`ionic build`

After you make changes you can build the app by:  
  
`ionic build`  
  
~ or ~  
  
`ionic build ios`  
`ionic build android`  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
To debug in a browser, run:  
  
`ionic lab`  
  
  
  
  
  
Install Android Studio and xcode.  
You can open the appropriate app under  
**ghvz/mobile/platforms/[ios,android]**  
and run the app from there.  
  
  
  
Remember to rebuild before running the app again to make  
sure all your changes get translated to ios and android.  
Using ionic lab should do this for you I think.
