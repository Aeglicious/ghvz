<b>TL;DR: Meet at charleston park!</b>
</p>
<p>
Men and women of the Stradivarius! You all know the situation. The zeds have overrun the planet beneath us, and soon they'll overrun every planet in the sector. With the communication tower down, our loved ones back on the planets will certainly be overrun by the zeds.
</p>
<p>
We are now in geosynchronous orbit above the sector’s communication tower. The area is completely crawling with zeds. Even if ships went down there to fix the tower, the zeds who have taken over the defense systems will shoot them down once they enter the atmosphere, and there’s certainly no chance that any ship will make it back into orbit afterwards.
</p>
<p>
It's a suicide mission. But for our families, we do what we must.
</p>
<p>
Once we get down to the surface, we must meet at the below location, a place the locals once called <b>Charleston Park</b>.
